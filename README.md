# SpringBootAssessment
Spring Boot Assessment Solstice

This project is part of the training on Spring Boot at Solstice, just a simple project for technical assessment.

### Couple of things to notice:
* For simplication I decided to use just the entity model classes for data transfer as well as persistence, to avoid using model mappers, write more services, etcetera.
* The application uses H2 database, the console is enabled and it can be accessed at /h2console, with "user" and "pass" as username and password respectively.
